Modules:

1) Learners
2) Employers
3) Training Providers
4) Government / Regulator (NCVET)

Each module developed independently with its own backend, database, and frontend. Then you integrate via APIs.


Module-wise Implementation Plan

A. Learner Module
Steps:
Registration & Profile → DB (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
Upload Certificates → Store in S3 / cloud storage
Certificate Verification → Use APIs / blockchain / digital signature
NSQF Mapping → Rule-based or ML model
Skill Profile → Aggregate verified credentials
AI Career Path Planner → Use ML recommendation engine
Job Matching → Elasticsearch / FAISS vector search
Dashboard → Frontend (React ) + API calls

Tech Stack Example:
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js / Django
Storage: S3
DB: PostgreSQL + Neo4j (skills graph)
AI: Python ML models for recommendations


B. Employer Module
Steps:
Login → Auth with JWT / OAuth2
Post Jobs → Store jobs in DB
Search Candidates → Use filters + Elasticsearch
AI Match Engine → Suggest candidates based on skills & NSQF
Shortlist & Contact → Email / SMS integration
Dashboard → Analytics, zero-fraud verification

Tech Stack:
Same frontend & backend as Learner module
Elasticsearch for candidate search
AI matching engine in Python


C. Training Provider Module
Steps:
Login → Auth
Issue Digital Certificates → PDF + Blockchain / Digital signature
Update Courses → Market demand analytics + DB
Dashboard → Track issued certificates & course relevance

Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js / Django
Certificate: PDF generation + optional blockchain
Frontend: React / Vue



D. Government / Regulator Module
Steps:
Login → Role-based access
Approve Credentials → API / blockchain verification
Update NSQF → Admin portal
Live Analytics → BigQuery / Redshift + BI tool
Policy & Fund Allocation → Dashboard
Audit → Blockchain / DB logs
Dashboard → National skill data visualization
Tech Stack:
Data Warehouse: BigQuery / Redshift
BI / Analytics: Tableau / Power BI
Frontend: React
